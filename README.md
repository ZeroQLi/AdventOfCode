# ZeroQL's 2022 advent of code

These are my solutions to the 2022 advent of code challenges. Originally written with love in python, but also in C++

This is definitely not efficient code but i'm proud of myself regardless.

switch to ``C++-airport`` branch for solutions in C++

## Terminology
```AOC_[day]_[part].py```
- ``day`` indicates the challenge number
- ``part`` indicates the associated part ``(1st or 2nd)``

for example ``AOC_5_P2.py`` would be my solution for the 2nd part of day 5

##  Testing

fork this repo or download the individual file and
place your input in the ``input.txt`` file

## 2021 Advent of Code

Change to the ``2021-airport`` branch (PYTHON ONLY, for now)

##### oh and star this rep too while your at it
