# ZeroQL's 2021 advent of code

These are my solutions to the 2021 advent of code challenges. Written with love in python (1 full year late)

This is definitely not efficient code but i'm proud of myself regardless.

## Terminology
```AOC_[day]_[part].py```
- ``day`` indicates the challenge number
- ``part`` indicates the associated part ``(1st or 2nd)``

for example ``AOC_5_P2.py`` would be my solution for the 2nd part of day 5

##  Testing

fork this repo or download the individual file and
place your input in the ``input.txt`` file
