# ZeroQL's 2023 advent of code
These are my solutions to the 2023 advent of code challenges.To be solved with python (and C++?, heven't decided)

This is definitely not efficient code but i'm proud of myself regardless.

## Terminology
```AOC_[day]_[part].py```
- ``day`` indicates the challenge number
- ``part`` indicates the associated part ``(1st or 2nd)``

Example: ``AOC_5_P2.py`` would be my solution for the 2nd part of day 5

## Testing

1. fork this repo or download the individual file
2. place your input in the ``input.txt`` file

## Previous year Challenges

Switch to the ``YEAR-airport`` branch for my solutions for the respective years (2022 and 2021, for now)

##### oh and star this rep too while your at it 

# Happy holidays
