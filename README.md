# ZeroQL's 2023 advent of code

These are my solutions to the 2023 advent of code challenges. Originally written with love in C++ 
(and maybe also in python?, haven't decided yet)

This is definitely not efficient code but i'm proud of myself regardless.

## Terminology
```AOC_[day]_[part].py```
- ``day`` indicates the challenge number
- ``part`` indicates the associated part ``(1st or 2nd)``

Example: ``AOC_5_P2.py`` would be my solution for the 2nd part of day 5

## Testing

fork this repo or download the individual file and
place your input in the ``input.txt`` file

## Previous Advent of Code Challenges

Switch to the ``YEAR-airport`` branch for my solutions for the respective years (2022 and 2021, for now)

``2022-C++-airport`` are my 2022 AOC solutions in C++
